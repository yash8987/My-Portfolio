          Hello! Iâ€™m Yash Sharma, a passionate and driven Full Stack Developer
          recently graduated from ABES Engineering College with a degree in
          Computer Science & Engineering(CSE). I specialize in both front-end
          and back-end technologies, aiming to deliver seamless and efficient
          web solutions.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p className="text-xl">
          My interest in web development ignited during my time at College,
          where I was exposed to the fundamentals of programming and web design.
          I quickly grew fascinated by the ability to turn lines of code into
          fully functional and visually appealing applications. Throughout my
          academic career, I engaged in various projects that equipped me with
          hands-on experience in technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
          React, Node.js, etc.
